# Bowmouth Analysis

This project contains some analysis performed on data regarding the bowmouth guitarfish. 
I have used R for most of my analyses. The layout is as follows:
- Rscripts: contains the R scripts of each analyses I wanted to achieve
- I have removed access to my data files as they contain sensitive information. If you want to follow the script you would need to add in your own data files in the format suggested in the script (mainly fasta files)
